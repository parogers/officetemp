Gameplay
--------

Play screen:

* Gameplay like Tapper
* Terrance the temp
* Multiple counters with men in business suits
* Filing cabinet beside each counter
* Throw paperwork along the counter to suits, they take time to sign them,
  then they throw them back
* Terrance has to catch the returned paperwork and feed into the fax machine
* Unlike Tapper - the suits don't get pushed back
* Instead you run out a timer / or maybe with certain number of papers faxed
* Counter becomes more populated with suits as play progresses
* Guy in sweater wants coffee?

Be your own boss
Be your own team
You decide how much you earn
Be your own boss
Hard work pays off
Temp work is flex work
Vacation time whenever you want
You don't eat. You coffee
